# node-red-oauth2-auth
OAuth2 client for getting oauth2 credentials by the authorization flow to use in other nodes. Credentials are automatically refreshed on expiration. After a successful authorization, the msg object has a new element *bearerToken* with the value **Bearer**Â *access token*. This element can be used of the authentication e.g. in the htmlRequest node. 

I liked to have an indepentent implementation of the oauth2 authentication flow. 
Inspired by https://github.com/node-red/node-red-web-nodes/tree/master/google, I implemented this node in a similar way.
Maybe it's useful for others. Up to now, there are no releases.
